## Form Validation Script

This project demonstrates how to validate a form using JavaScript before submitting it. The script provides basic real-time validation for several form fields such as email, password, re-entered password, fullname, and merchant name. It also ensures the form can only be submitted if all validations pass.

## Features:

- Email validation: Checks if the email input is valid using the built-in HTML5 validation.
- Password validation: Validates the password against a regular expression to ensure it contains uppercase, lowercase, digits, and is at least 8 characters long.
- Re-password validation: Ensures that the re-entered password matches the original password.
- Full name validation: Ensures that the full name is not empty and trims unnecessary whitespace.

Form submission control: Prevents form submission if any validation fails and provides feedback by highlighting invalid fields.
